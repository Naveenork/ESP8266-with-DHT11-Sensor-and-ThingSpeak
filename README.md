# ESP8266-with-DHT11-Sensor-and-ThingSpeak
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module with a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to send data to ThingSpeak, an IoT cloud platform. The ESP8266 connects to a Wi-Fi network and sends temperature and humidity readings from the DHT11 sensor to ThingSpeak at regular intervals.
